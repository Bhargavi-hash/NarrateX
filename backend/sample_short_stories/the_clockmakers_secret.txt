The Clockmaker’s Secret

Elena Davidson pushed open the dusty door of the clock shop. “Mr. Finch? Are you here?” she called.

From behind the counter, the old clockmaker emerged, wiping grease from his hands. “Ah, Elena,” said Mr. Finch. “Right on time, as always.”

In the corner, Marcus adjusted his glasses. “You’re late, actually,” he muttered, scribbling in his notebook.

“Ignore him,” said Clara, balancing a tray of tea cups. “He’s been grumpy since sunrise.”

A sudden bark startled them — Rufus, the golden retriever, bounded through the doorway, dragging little Jamie behind him.

“Rufus!” Jamie gasped. “You’re going to knock over the clocks!”

Mr. Finch frowned. “Careful now. These gears are older than all of you combined.”

Elena glanced around the room. “So… what’s the big secret you wanted to show me?”

The old man hesitated. “It’s not ready yet,” he said slowly. “But when it is, time itself might stop.”

Marcus snorted. “Or maybe your brain will, old man.”

“Marcus!” Clara snapped. “Don’t be rude.”

Jamie looked up at Rufus, whispering, “I think I believe him.”
